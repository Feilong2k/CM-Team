# Agents Documentation

This folder contains system prompts and role definitions for all CM-TEAM agents.

## Structure

- **01-Orion/**: System prompts and role definitions for Orion (primary orchestrator)
- **02-Adam/**: Architect prompts and role definitions for Adam
- **03-Tara/**: Tester prompts and role definitions for Tara  
- **04-Devon/**: Developer prompts and role definitions for Devon

## Purpose

Each agent folder contains:
- `prompts/`: System prompt files defining the agent's behavior and capabilities
- `role-definition.md`: Detailed role description and responsibilities

## Usage

1. **For Agent Development**: Reference these prompts when extending agent capabilities
2. **For Testing**: Use as baseline for agent behavior validation
3. **For Integration**: Understand agent roles and interaction patterns

## Notes

- Agent prompts follow a consistent format across all agents
- Role definitions include boundaries, responsibilities, and operating protocols
- Updates to agent prompts should be coordinated across the team
