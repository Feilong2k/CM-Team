# Architecture Documentation

This folder contains system architecture documents, design decisions, and technical specifications.

## Structure

- **decisions/**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key technical decisions
- **designs/**: System design documents and architecture diagrams
- **specifications/**: Technical specifications and models

## Purpose

- **ADRs**: Capture rationale for architectural choices, alternatives considered, and consequences
- **Designs**: Document system architecture, component interactions, and design patterns
- **Specifications**: Define technical requirements, data models, and interface contracts

## Usage

1. **For Development**: Reference designs when implementing new features
2. **For Review**: Use ADRs to understand historical decisions
3. **For Planning**: Consult specifications when scoping work
4. **For Onboarding**: Review architecture documents to understand system structure

## Notes

- ADRs follow a consistent template (see templates folder)
- Designs include both high-level overviews and detailed component diagrams
- Specifications are versioned and include change history
- All architecture documents are living documents that should be updated as the system evolves
