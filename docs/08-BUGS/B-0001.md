## Title
EntityModal Basic Info Display Uses Only Half the Modal Width

## Description
The basic info section in the EntityModal component does not utilize the full width and height of the modal as expected. Despite multiple attempts to adjust CSS and layout, the display remains constrained to the top half or half the width of the modal, limiting usability and readability.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the EntityModal in the application.
2. Observe the basic info tab content area.
3. Notice that the content only uses half the available modal space.

## Expected Behavior
The basic info display should expand to use the full width and height of the modal content area, extending down to the message input box, with scrollbars if content overflows.

## Actual Behavior
The basic info display is restricted to a smaller area, approximately half the modal height or width.

## Attempts to Fix
- Removed fixed height constraints on modal content.
- Adjusted flexbox properties and widths.
- Set overflow properties for scrolling.
- Changes applied to SubtaskModal.vue instead of EntityModal.vue initially.
- Multiple replace_in_file attempts with no effect.

## Impact
Limits user ability to view and interact with detailed basic info content in the modal, affecting usability and review efficiency.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Conduct a thorough review of EntityModal.vue layout and parent containers.
- Remove or adjust any CSS constraints limiting modal content size.
- Consider redesigning modal layout for flexible content sizing.
- Test changes incrementally to verify effect.

## Priority
