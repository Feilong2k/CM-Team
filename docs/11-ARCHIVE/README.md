# Archive

This folder contains archived documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for historical reference.

## Purpose

- **Historical Reference**: Preserve previous versions of documents for audit trails and historical context
- **Deprecated Content**: Store documents that have been superseded by newer versions
- **Learning Resource**: Provide examples of previous approaches and decisions
- **Backup**: Maintain copies of documents that may be referenced in historical discussions

## Contents

### Main Archive
- Older roadmap versions (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- Deprecated implementation requirements
- Previous protocol versions (CDP renamed to PCC for consistency)
- Historical technical specifications

### F2-T0 Archive
- Feature 2, Task 0 related documents
- Decision records and specifications
- Planning documents from early phases

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Reference Only**: Archive documents should not be edited directly
2. **Historical Context**: Use to understand evolution of the system
3. **Learning**: Study previous approaches to inform current decisions
4. **Audit**: Trace document evolution and decision history

## Naming Conventions

- Files retain their original names with date context
- CDP files have been renamed to PCC for consistency with current naming
- Version numbers indicate document evolution
- Folder structure mirrors original organization where applicable

## Notes

- Archive is read-only - no new documents should be created here
- Documents moved to archive should be clearly superseded by newer versions
- The archive serves as a knowledge base, not active documentation
- Regular review may be needed to ensure archive remains relevant but not bloated
